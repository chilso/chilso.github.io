	<div class="intro">
		<p>The Chicago Late Starters Orchestra is a brand new amateur string orchestra in the Chicago area. It was founded in the fall of 2015 
		and was inspired by the East London Late Starters Orchestra (ELLSO), which has been going strong since the 1980s. Several Late Starters Orchestras 
		have since sprung up around the world, including New York and now Chicago.
		</p>
		
		<p>The Chicago Late Starters Orchestra is aimed at adults who have only recently started playing a string instrument or played an instrument before but 
		let their skills get rusty. Our goal is to create a fun and supportive environment for beginning string players aged 18 to 118 who 
		want to play music with a group of people of a similar skill level. We believe that making music is for everyone and that it is never 
		too late to learn!
		</p>
		
		<p>We meet on Sunday mornings and play music together under the direction of Ben Traisman, who picks out some fun music for us to 
		play ranging from classical music to more modern pieces.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Joining</h2>
		<p>
		There are no auditions. Just let us know you're coming so we can send you some sheet music in advance.
		Absolute beginners are very welcome, but it is recommended that you have been playing for at least a year.
		Don't worry about joining in the middle of the season, we always welcome new members!
		</p>
